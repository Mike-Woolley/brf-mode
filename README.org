* Brf-Mode
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: brf-mode
:END:

Brf-Mode adds functionality from the old DOS editor [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_%28text_editor%29][Brief]] to Emacs.

This package is not an emulation of Brief (there are plenty of those already), but rather provides an accurate
implementation in Emacs of specific features that I miss from Brief.

The emphasis is on accurately implementing these specific features in Emacs rather than doing what Brief emulations tend
to do, which is mapping the Brief key-sequences to somewhat similar functions in Emacs.

The features are:

- [[#line-and-column-mode-cut-and-paste][Line-mode cut and paste]]
- [[#line-and-column-mode-cut-and-paste][Column-mode cut and paste]]
- [[#reversible-paging-and-scrolling][Fully reversible paging and scrolling]]
- [[#temporary-bookmarks][Temporary bookmarks]]
- [[#cursor-motion-undo][Cursor motion undo]]
- [[#easy-window-management][Easy window management]]

They have been implemented in an Emacs-style. This means the functions respond to prefix args and where they override
Emacs functions, they live on the Emacs key bindings as well as the original Brief keys.

Moreover, functionality has been extended to those parts of Emacs that were never part of Brief. For example, text
cut/copied in line or column-mode can be saved/recalled in registers.

Some functionality was neither part of Brief nor Emacs (for example [[#list-bookmarks][List Bookmarks]]) and the mode generally uses the
prefix ~C-c C-b~ for such commands.

Brf-mode puts a ~Brf~ sub-menu under ~Edit~. In keeping with Brief's minimalist ethos, the menu only houses these more
difficult to access commands and also has links to preferences, help, the manual and project website.

** Installation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: installation
:END:

- Installation from MELPA

[[https://melpa.org/#/brf][https://melpa.org/packages/brf-badge.svg]]

   1. Make sure [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][melpa is in your package archives list]].
   2. ~M-x package-install brf~


- Manual Installation


1. Download the package to a directory and add it to your ~load-path~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-to-list 'load-path <install directory>)
#+END_SRC

2. [@2]Install the Info manual [optional].

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ cd <install directory>
  $ install-info brf-mode.info
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'Info-directory-list <install directory>)
#+END_SRC

- Enable Brf-Mode

This can be done via [[#customisation][Customize]] or adding code to your startup file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (brf-mode)
#+END_SRC

Choosing "Enable Brf-Mode" from the "Brf" menu, toggles the mode on or off for the current session.

** Customisation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: customisation
:END:

~M-x customize-group brf~

- Options

Customisable options are:

1. Bookmark Face
2. Bookmark Number face (when shown in Fringe)
3. Enable Brf-Mode
4. Mode-line string (including hiding)
5. Enable [[#cursor-motion-undo][Cursor Motion Undo]]


- Key mapping

Default key mappings can be changed by modifying ~brf-mode-map~ in the mode hook.

As an example, here's what I'm using myself:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'brf-mode-hook
    (lambda ()
      (define-key brf-mode-map "\M-r" 'redo)                ; Redo from redo+.el
      (define-key brf-mode-map "\M-a" nil)                  ; Don't use Brief Alt-a for marking
      (define-key brf-mode-map "\M-m" nil)                  ; Don't use Brief Alt-m for marking
      (define-key brf-mode-map "\C-xl" 'downcase-word)      ; Shadowed by Alt-l
      (define-key brf-mode-map "\C-xu" 'upcase-word)        ; Shadowed by Alt-u
      (define-key brf-mode-map "\C-xw" 'capitalize-word)))  ; Shadowed by Alt-c
#+END_SRC

** Dependencies
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: dependencies
   :END:
   
   Brf-mode doesn't have any hard dependencies, but installing the following optional packages enables some extra
   capabilities:

   - [[https://melpa.org/#/fringe-helper][fringe-helper]]: When installed, bookmark numbers show in the fringe.
     Installing Brf-mode via ~package-install~ automatically installs ~fringe-helper~.
   - [[https://melpa.org/#/pkg-info][pkg-info]]: When installed, ~(brf-version)~ shows the package version as well as the Brf-mode version.

** Compatibility
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: compatibility
   :END:

   The MELPA package (Brf-mode version "v1.16-MELPA" onward) requires Gnu Emacs 24.3, due to the requirements of being a package.

   Earlier versions of Brf-mode will however work on older versions of Gnu Emacs and also on XEmacs:
   
   - Use "v1.16" for Gnu Emacs versions 21 -> 24.2.
   - Use "v1.08" for XEmacs and Gnu Emacs 20 & earlier.

   These and any other versions can be download from the [[https://bitbucket.org/MikeWoolley/brf-mode/downloads/?tab=tags][Brf-mode website]] and installed manually.

** Line and Column Mode Cut and Paste
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: line-and-column-mode-cut-and-paste
:END:

- Mark regions by whole line or column.
- If no region is marked, the copy and kill commands operate on the current line.
- Yanked text is inserted in line or column mode, if that's how it was marked.
- Text in Line or Column mode can be stored and recalled from registers, as well as the kill-ring.

** Temporary Bookmarks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: temporary-bookmarks
:END:

- 10 bookmarks can be set and navigated between.
- They can also be moved and deleted.
- They are temporary in the sense they don't persist between invocations of Emacs.
- As an extension to Brief, bookmark lines are highlighted in colour. This is [[#customisation][customisable]].
- If the package ~fringe-helper~ is installed, the bookmark number is put in the fringe (which otherwise shows as a tooltip).
- Bookmarks can be listed & chosen from a menu, [[#list-bookmarks][see below]]. This is also an extension to Brief.
- Other extensions are a command to allocate the next free bookmark and one to delete all bookmarks.

** Cursor Motion Undo
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cursor-motion-undo
:END:

- Cursor motion, without any buffer changes, is recorded as an undo-able (& redo-able) action.
- This works with both built-in Emacs Undo and also with the ~Redo.el~ & ~Redo+.el~ packages. I haven't tested it with
  the plethora of other Undo packages - it should work, but you never know!
- It is turned off by default (unlike in Brief), but can be enabled by customising option ~brf-undo-enable~.

| Key         | Action                                 |
|-------------+----------------------------------------|
| kp-multiply | Undo                                   |
| M-u         | Undo                                   |
| M-r         | Redo (if ~redo~ or ~redo+~ installed). |

** Easy Window Management
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: easy-window-management
:END:

- Create, Switch, Resize and Delete arbitrary windows with simple keystrokes.

| Key                        | Action                        |
|----------------------------+-------------------------------|
| S- [up, down, right, left] | Switch to Window in Direction |
| f1 [up, down, right, left] | Switch to window in Direction |
| f2 [up, down, right, left] | Resize Window in Direction    |
| M-f2                       | Zoom Window                   |
| f3 [up, down, right, left] | Create Window in Direction    |
| f4 [up, down, right, left] | Delete Window in Direction    |
| C-f4                       | Delete Current Window         |
| S-f4                       | Delete Other Windows          |

** Differences From Brief
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: differences-from-brief
:END:

#+CAPTION: Screenshot of the original BRIEF
[[https://bitbucket.org/MikeWoolley/brf-mode/raw/master/images/BRIEF-Screenshot.png]]

- Inclusive Mark (Alt-m)

"Inclusive" character marking in Brief includes the character under the cursor, whereas in Brf-Mode (and Emacs in
general) the marked region stops on the character before the cursor. This behaviour is actually Brief's "Non-inclusive
Mark" and is the only kind supported in Brf-Mode. I don't think it makes any practical difference and so "Inclusive
Mark" has not been implemented in Brf-Mode.

- Window Resizing (F2)

When resizing a window in Brief, the user has to hit Enter to end resizing and all other keys are ignored. In Brf-Mode,
any key or click that is not a cursor key ends resizing, which I personally think is better.

** Known Issues
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: known-issues
:END:

Please report any issues at the [[https://bitbucket.org/MikeWoolley/brf-mode/issues][Brf-mode website bug tracker]].

There are a couple of known minor issues:

- XEmacs Compatibility

Brf-mode no longer works in XEmacs. It's likely to be fairly easy to fix the compatibility issues, but given the demise of
XEmacs I don't have any current plans to do this.

Anyone wanting to run Brf-mode on XEmacs should install an older version, as described in [[#compatibility][Compatibility]].

- Menu & Toolbar commands for Cut & Paste

Brf-mode replaces the Cut & Paste menu and toolbar commands with versions that respect Line & Column Mode in the same
way as the Brf-mode keyboard commands. However Emacs disables the menu and toolbar ~Cut~ & ~Copy~ items if there is no
marked region, unlike the corresponding Brf-mode keyboard commands.
