1 Brf-mode
**********

Brf-mode adds functionality from the legendary DOS editor Brief
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_%28text_editor%29) to Emacs.

   This package is not an emulation of Brief (there are plenty of those
already), but rather provides an accurate implementation in Emacs of
specific features that I miss from Brief.

   The emphasis is on accurately implementing these specific features in
Emacs rather than doing what Brief emulations tend to do, which is
mapping the Brief key-sequences to somewhat similar functions in Emacs.

   The features are:

   • *note Line-mode cut and paste: Line and Column Mode Cut and Paste.
   • *note Column-mode cut and paste: Line and Column Mode Cut and
     Paste.
   • *note Fully reversible paging and scrolling: Reversible Paging and
     Scrolling.
   • *note Temporary bookmarks: Temporary Bookmarks.
   • *note Cursor motion undo: Cursor Motion Undo.
   • *note Easy window management: Easy Window Management.

   They have been implemented in an Emacs-style.  This means the
functions respond to prefix args and where they override Emacs
functions, they live on the Emacs key bindings as well as the original
Brief keys.

   Moreover, functionality has been extended to those parts of Emacs
that were never part of Brief.  For example, text cut/copied in line or
column-mode can be saved/recalled in registers.

   Some functionality was neither part of Brief nor Emacs (for example
*note List Bookmarks::) and the mode generally uses the prefix ‘C-c C-b’
for such commands.

   Brf-mode puts a ‘Brf’ sub-menu under ‘Edit’.  In keeping with Brief’s
minimalist ethos, the menu only houses these more difficult to access
commands and also has links to preferences, help, the manual and project
website.

2.1 Installation
================

The easiest way is to install the ‘brf’ package from MELPA, however
Brf-mode can also be installed manually if desired:

   • Installation from MELPA

     https://melpa.org/packages/brf-badge.svg (https://melpa.org/#/brf)
     https://stable.melpa.org/packages/brf-badge.svg
     (https://stable.melpa.org/#/brf)

       1. Make sure melpa is in your package archives list
          (https://melpa.org/#/getting-started).
       2. ‘M-x package-install brf’

   • Manual Installation

       1. Download the package to a directory and add it to your
          ‘load-path’:

               (add-to-list 'load-path <install directory>)

       2. Install the Info manual [optional].

               $ cd <install directory>
               $ install-info brf-mode.info

               (add-to-list 'Info-directory-list <install directory>)

   • Enable Brf-mode

     This can be done via *note Customize: Customisation. or adding code
     to your startup file:

          (brf-mode)

     Choosing "Enable Brf-mode" from the "Brf" menu, toggles the mode on
     or off for the current session.


File: brf-mode.info,  Node: Customisation,  Next: Dependencies,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Setup

2.2 Customisation
=================

‘M-x customize-group brf’

   • Options

     Customisable options are:

       1. Bookmark Face
       2. Bookmark Number face (when shown in Fringe)
       3. Enable Brf-mode
       4. Mode-line string (including hiding)
       5. Enable *note Cursor Motion Undo::

   • Key mapping

     Default key mappings can be changed by modifying ‘brf-mode-map’ in
     the mode hook.

     As an example, here’s what I’m using myself:

          (add-hook 'brf-mode-hook
                    (lambda ()
                      (define-key brf-mode-map "\M-r" 'redo)                ; Redo from redo+.el
                      (define-key brf-mode-map "\M-a" nil)                  ; Don't use Brief Alt-a for marking
                      (define-key brf-mode-map "\M-m" nil)                  ; Don't use Brief Alt-m for marking
                      (define-key brf-mode-map "\C-xl" 'downcase-word)      ; Shadowed by Alt-l
                      (define-key brf-mode-map "\C-xu" 'upcase-word)        ; Shadowed by Alt-u
                      (define-key brf-mode-map "\C-xw" 'capitalize-word)))  ; Shadowed by Alt-c

2.3 Dependencies
================

Brf-mode doesn’t have any hard dependencies, but installing the
following optional packages enables some extra capabilities:

   • fringe-helper (https://melpa.org/#/fringe-helper): When installed,
     bookmark numbers show in the fringe.  Installing Brf-mode via
     ‘package-install’ automatically installs ‘fringe-helper’.

   • pkg-info (https://melpa.org/#/pkg-info): When installed,
     ‘(brf-version)’ shows the package version as well as the Brf-mode
     version.


File: brf-mode.info,  Node: Compatibility,  Prev: Dependencies,  Up: Setup

2.4 Compatibility
=================

The MELPA package (Brf-mode version "v1.16-MELPA" onward) requires Gnu
Emacs 24.3, due to the requirements of being a package.

   Earlier versions of Brf-mode will however work on older versions of
Gnu Emacs and also on XEmacs:

   • Use "v1.16" for Gnu Emacs versions 21 -> 24.2.
   • Use "v1.08" for XEmacs and Gnu Emacs 20 & earlier.

   These and any other version can be download from the Brf-mode website
(https://bitbucket.org/MikeWoolley/brf-mode/downloads/?tab=tags) and
installed manually.

3.1 Line and Column Mode Cut and Paste
======================================

   • Mark regions by whole line or column.
   • If no region is marked, the copy and kill commands operate on the
     current line.
   • Yanked text is inserted in line or column mode, if that’s how it
     was marked.
   • Text in Line or Column mode can be stored and recalled from
     registers, as well as the kill-ring.

3.2 Reversible Paging and Scrolling
===================================

   • Paging and scrolling respect relative screen row and absolute
     column.
   • Paging up and then down again returns point to the same original
     position.

Key      Action
-----------------------------------------
next     page-down
C-v      page-down
prior    page-up
M-v      page-up

end      End of Line/Page/Buffer


File: brf-mode.info,  Node: Temporary Bookmarks,  Next: List Bookmarks,  Prev: Reversible Paging and Scrolling,  Up: Features

3.3 Temporary Bookmarks
=======================

   • 10 bookmarks can be set and navigated between.
   • They can also be moved and deleted.
   • They are temporary in the sense they don’t persist between
     invocations of Emacs.
   • As an extension to Brief, bookmark lines are highlighted in colour.
     This is *note customisable: Customisation.
   • If the package ‘fringe-helper’ is installed, the bookmark number is
     put in the fringe (which otherwise shows as a tooltip).
   • Bookmarks can be listed & chosen from a menu, *note see below: List
     Bookmarks.  This is also an extension to Brief.
   • Other extensions are a command to allocate the next free bookmark
     and one to delete all bookmarks.

   <https://bitbucket.org/MikeWoolley/brf-mode/raw/master/images/bookmarks.png>

Key                   Action
-------------------------------------------------------------

File: brf-mode.info,  Node: Cursor Motion Undo,  Next: Easy Window Management,  Prev: List Bookmarks,  Up: Features

3.5 Cursor Motion Undo
======================

   • Cursor motion, without any buffer changes, is recorded as an
     undo-able (& redo-able) action.
   • This works with both built-in Emacs Undo and also with the
     ‘Redo.el’ & ‘Redo+.el’ packages.  I haven’t tested it with the
     plethora of other Undo packages - it should work, but you never
     know!
   • It is turned off by default (unlike in Brief), but can be enabled
     by customising option ‘brf-undo-enable’.

Key           Action
-------------------------------------------------------
kp-multiply   Undo
M-u           Undo
M-r           Redo (if ‘redo’ or ‘redo+’ installed).


File: brf-mode.info,  Node: Easy Window Management,  Next: Differences From Brief,  Prev: Cursor Motion Undo,  Up: Features

3.6 Easy Window Management
==========================

   • Create, Switch, Resize and Delete arbitrary windows with simple
     keystrokes.

Key                          Action
-------------------------------------------------------------
S- [up, down, right, left]   Switch to Window in Direction
f1 [up, down, right, left]   Switch to window in Direction
f2 [up, down, right, left]   Resize Window in Direction
M-f2                         Zoom Window
f3 [up, down, right, left]   Create Window in Direction
f4 [up, down, right, left]   Delete Window in Direction
C-f4                         Delete Current Window
S-f4                         Delete Other Windows

3.7 Differences From Brief
==========================

<https://bitbucket.org/MikeWoolley/brf-mode/raw/master/images/BRIEF-Screenshot.png>

   • Inclusive Mark (Alt-m)

     "Inclusive" character marking in Brief includes the character under
     the cursor, whereas in Brf-mode (and Emacs in general) the marked
     region stops on the character before the cursor.  This behaviour is
     actually Brief’s "Non-inclusive Mark" and is the only kind
     supported in Brf-mode.  I don’t think it makes any practical
     difference and so "Inclusive Mark" has not been implemented in
     Brf-mode.

   • Window Resizing (F2)

     When resizing a window in Brief, the user has to hit Enter to end
     resizing and all other keys are ignored.  In Brf-mode, any key or
     click that is not a cursor key ends resizing, which I personally
     think is better.


File: brf-mode.info,  Node: Known Issues,  Prev: Differences From Brief,  Up: Features

3.8 Known Issues
================

Please report any issues at the Brf-mode website bug tracker
(https://bitbucket.org/MikeWoolley/brf-mode/issues).

   There are a couple of known minor issues:

   • XEmacs Compatibility

     Brf-mode no longer works in XEmacs.  It’s likely to be fairly easy
     to fix the compatibility issues, but given the demise of XEmacs I
     don’t have any current plans to do this.

     Anyone wanting to run Brf-mode on XEmacs should install an older
     version, as described in *note Compatibility::.

   • Menu & Toolbar commands for Cut & Paste

     Brf-mode replaces the Cut & Paste menu and toolbar commands with
     versions that respect Line & Column Mode in the same way as the
     Brf-mode keyboard commands.  However Emacs disables the menu and
     toolbar ‘Cut’ & ‘Copy’ items if there is no marked region, unlike
     the corresponding Brf-mode keyboard commands.
