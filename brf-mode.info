Brf-Mode adds functionality from the old DOS editor Brief
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_(text_editor)) to Emacs.

1.1 Summary
===========

This package is not an emulation of Brief (there are plenty of those
already), but rather provides an accurate implementation in Emacs of
specific features that I miss from Brief.

   The emphasis is on accurately implementing these specific features
in Emacs rather than doing what Brief emulations tend to do, which is
mapping the Brief key-sequences to similar functions in Emacs.

   Principally these features are:

   * *Note Line-mode cut and paste:
     #line-and-column-mode-cut-and-paste.

   * *Note Column-mode cut and paste:
     #line-and-column-mode-cut-and-paste.

   * *Note Fully reversible paging and scrolling:
     #reversible-paging-and-scrolling.

   * *Note Temporary bookmarks: #temporary-bookmarks.

   * *Note Cursor motion undo: #cursor-motion-undo.

   * *Note Easy window management: #easy-window-management.

   However they have been implemented in an Emacs-style. This means
the functions respond to prefix args and where they override Emacs
functions, they live on the Emacs key bindings as well as the original
Brief keys.

   Moreover, functionality has been extended to those parts of Emacs
that were never part of Brief. For example, text cut/copied in line or
column-mode can be saved/recalled in registers.

   Also some functionality was never part of Brief nor Emacs (for
example *Note `List Bookmarks': #list-bookmarks. and the mode uses
the prefix `C-c C-b' for such commands.

File: brf-mode.info,  Node: Line and Column Mode Cut and Paste,  Next: Reversible Paging and Scrolling,  Up: Features

1.3.1 Line and Column Mode Cut and Paste
----------------------------------------

   * Mark regions by whole line or column.

   * If no region is marked, the copy and kill commands operate on the
     current line.

   * Yanked text is inserted in line or column mode, if that's how it
     was marked.

   * Text in Line or Column mode can be stored and recalled from
     registers, as well as the kill-ring.

Key           Action
-------------------------------------- 
M-l           Start line marking
M-c           Start column marking
M-m           Start normal marking
kp-add        Copy Line or Region
M-w           Copy Line or Region
kp-subtract   Kill Line or Region
C-w           Kill Line or Region
kp-ins        Yank
C-y           Yank
M-y           Yank Pop

C-c C-b C-w   Copy to Register
C-c C-b C-y   Insert Register

M-d           Delete Line
delete        Delete Region or Char

RET           Newline and Indent
C-j           Newline

Tab           Indent

1.3.2 Reversible Paging and Scrolling
-------------------------------------

   * Paging and scrolling respect relative screen row and absolute
     column.

   * Paging up and then down again returns point to the same original
     position.

Key      Action
----------------------------------------- 
next     page-down
C-v      page-down
prior    page-up
M-v      page-up
M-down   scroll-down
M-up     scroll-up
home     Beginning of Line/Page/Buffer
end      End of Line/Page/Buffer


File: brf-mode.info,  Node: Temporary Bookmarks,  Next: List Bookmarks,  Prev: Reversible Paging and Scrolling,  Up: Features

1.3.3 Temporary Bookmarks
-------------------------

   * 10 bookmarks can be set and navigated between.

   * They can also be moved and deleted.

   * They are temporary in the sense they don't persist between
     invocations of Emacs.

   * As an extension to Brief, bookmark lines are highlighted in
     colour (customisable).

   * If the package `fringe-helper' is installed, the bookmark number
     is put in the fringe (which otherwise shows as a tooltip).

   * If the package `generic-menu' is installed, bookmarks can be
     listed & chosen from a menu, *Note see below: #list-bookmarks.
     This is also an extension to Brief.

   * Other extensions are a command to allocate the next free
     bookmark and one to delete all bookmarks.

Key                   Action
------------------------------------------------------------- 
M-0 to M-9            Drop bookmark 0-9 at point
With prefix arg C-u   Removes bookmark.
M-=                   Goto Next Bookmark
M-kp-add              Goto Next Bookmark
M-kp-subtract         Goto Previous Bookmark
M-                    Goto Previous Bookmark
M-j                   Jump-to-Bookmark

C-c C-b C-k           Delete All Bookmarks
C-c C-b C-l           List Bookmarks
C-c C-b C-n           Goto Next Bookmark
C-c C-b C-p           Goto Previous Bookmark
C-c C-b =             Allocate Next Free Bookmark at Point

1.3.4 List Bookmarks
--------------------

key   Action
---------------------------------- 
RET   Jump to bookmark at point
d     Delete bookmark at point
k     Delete All bookmarks
q     Quit


File: brf-mode.info,  Node: Cursor Motion Undo,  Next: Easy Window Management,  Prev: List Bookmarks,  Up: Features

1.3.5 Cursor Motion Undo
------------------------

   * Cursor motion, without any buffer changes, is recorded as an
     undo-able (& redo-able) action.

   * This works with both built-in Emacs Undo and also with the
     `Redo.el' & `Redo+.el' packages. I haven't tested it with the
     plethora of other Undo packages - it should work, but you never
     know!

   * It is turned off by default (unlike in Brief), but can enabled by
     Customise option `b-undo-enable'.

Key           Action
------------------------------------------------------- 
kp-multiply   Undo
M-u           Undo
M-r           Redo (if `redo' or `redo+' installed).


File: brf-mode.info,  Node: Easy Window Management,  Prev: Cursor Motion Undo,  Up: Features

1.3.6 Easy Window Management
----------------------------

   * Create, Switch, Resize and Delete arbitrary windows with simple
     keystrokes.

Key                          Action
------------------------------------------------------------- 
S- [up, down, right, left]   Switch to Window in Direction
f1 [up, down, right, left]   Switch to window in Direction
f2 [up, down, right, left]   Resize Window in Direction
f3 [up, down, right, left]   Create Window in Direction
f4 [up, down, right, left]   Delete Window in Direction
C-f4                         Delete Current Window
S-f4                         Delete Other Windows
