2020-03-05  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el: Changed to lexical-binding.
	Added package tags.
	(b-mode): Changes for lexical-binding.

	* b-bookmark.el: Changed to lexical-binding.
	(b-get-bookmark): Added this new accessor to
	replace all the explicit `aref' calls.
	(b-create-bookmark): Changes for lexical-binding.
	(b-next-bookmark): Workaround lexical-binding "unused variable" warning.
	(b-list-bookmarks): Stopped unavailability of `generic-menu'
	generating an error.

	* b-window.el:
	* b-undo.el:
	* b-movement.el:
	* b-marking.el:
	* b-editing.el:
	* b-compat.el: Changed to lexical-binding.

2020-02-29  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-movement.el (b-scroll-screen): Changed the code to use the
	core C Emacs scrolling functions for paging if
	`scroll-preserve-screen-position' is available and set. This is
	because the builtin functions are more accurate when dealing with
	mixed font heights, hidden lines etc.

	* b.el (b-mode): Set `scroll-preserve-screen-position' to t, if
	available in this version of Emacs.
	* b.el (b-version): Increased version to 1.16 to reflect the
	recent changes..

2020-02-26  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-movement.el (b-window-height): Changed this function to handle
	the different kinds of line-spacing and to return a more accurate
	idea of the window height.
	(b-page-down):
	(b-page-up): Not sure why I was subtracting 1 from the
	window-height (presumably because the window-height was wrong), so
	removed this.
	Also set minimum scrolled lines to 1.

	* b-bookmark.el:
	* b-movement.el: Put back the non "cl-" macros, as this is how the
	code was originally and these days I'm silencing byte-compiler
	warnings about `cl' by requiring it at compile time.

2020-02-20  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-bookmark.el (b-make-set-bookmark): Changed to return a named
	function rather than a lambda, so that the functions show up in the
	mode / keymap help etc.

	* b.el (b-mode-map): Added new command to delete all windows other
	than the current one.  I also realised the way I was defining the
	key map made it difficult to modify it interactively when writing
	new code, so I've changed this now.

2020-02-19  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-window.el (b-delete-current-window): Added function (& f4
	key-mapping) to delete the current window.

	* b.el (b-mode): Force conservative scrolling in B mode.
	(b-version): Increased B package version to 1.15.

	* b-marking.el (b-insert-register): Handle prefix arg the same as
	`insert-register'. In particular, with no prefix arg set point
	after the inserted text.

2020-02-12  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-window.el: New file to implement Brief-style window
	management.

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.14.
	(b-mode-map): Added key bindings for Brief-style window management.

2020-02-11  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-undo.el: Finished implementing Cursor Motion Undo (finally!).
	(b-undo-post-command-hook): Made Undo & Redo work
	properly with both default Emacs Undo and Redo(+).el.
	(b-undo-debug): Fixed the behaviour so it updates going down the
	page and tries to keep the most recent line visible. Also limited
	the lists to the first 15 items.

	* b.el: Brought the Copyright statements up-to-date.
	(b-version): Increased B package version to 1.13.

2020-02-02  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-mode-map): I had forgotten to put undo on M-u, in
	addition to kp-*.

	* b-marking.el (b-emphasise-region): Changed to display a message
	if the region was not emphasised (because the other end of the
	region is not visible), rather than do nothing as happened
	before. This was based on the behaviour of `indicate-copied-region'.

2020-01-31  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-marking.el:
	* b.el: Use the new Gnu Emacs `rectangle-mark-mode' to
	implement Brief Column Marking.
	Also finished implementing the existing register functions.

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.12.

2019-05-05  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-bookmark.el: Use the Fringe to show bookmark numbers rather
	than the Margin. The Margin is more flexible, but I think it looks
	odd with the Margin on the outside of the Fringe. It also looks
	weird when the margin is suddenly added.

	* b-compat.el: Removed the Margin flag.

	* b-editing.el:
	* b-marking.el:
	* b-movement.el: Cleaned up remaining compiler warnings.

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.11.

2019-02-28  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.10.

	* b-bookmark.el (b-current-column): Fixed documentation.

	* b-editing.el (b-insert-line): Indent by calling the function
	invoked by RET rather than assuming this is `newline-and-indent',
	which it isn't in c-mode.

2019-02-20  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el: Changed all the elisp files to remove the byte-compiler
	warnings, which were mostly to do with DocString formats.

2019-02-04  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-mode-map): Added key mapping for the new function.

	* b-bookmark.el (b-allocate-next-available-bookmark): Added new
	command to allocate the next available free bookmark, regardless
	of number.

	* b-compat.el: Correction to fix to silence the byte-compiler.

2019-02-02  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.09, to
	reflect all the recent fixes.

	* b-compat.el: The code to silence the byte-compiler warnings
	wasn't working in Emacs 26.

	* b-bookmark.el (b-read-bookmark-number): Fixed bug with invalid
	input reading bookmark number.
	Fixed compile warning for (labels).
	(b-margin-support-flag): Fixed compile warning.
	(b-bookmark-number-face): Scaled down font size of bookmark number face.

2019-02-01  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-compat.el (b-margin-support-flag): Fix bug preventing the
	bookmark number from showing in the margin.

	* b-movement.el (b-window-height): Fixed bug causing paging to
	move too far when line-spacing was set to something.

2004-02-14  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-marking.el (b-copy-region): Behaviour of `kill-ring-save' has
	changed in 21.3.50, so code adjusted to emphasise region by hand.

2004-02-04  Mike Woolley  <mike@arielcommunications.co.uk>

	* b-compat.el: Disable use of margins in CVS Emacs, as there are
	many display bugs.

2003-04-10  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-marking.el (b-yank): Only indent line mode yank if buffer is
	in a programming mode.
