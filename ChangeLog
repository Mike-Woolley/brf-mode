	* b-marking.el (b-emphasise-region): Changed to display a message
	if the region was not emphasised (because the other end of the
	region is not visible), rather than do nothing as happened
	before. This was based on the behaviour of `indicate-copied-region'.

	* b-marking.el:
	* b.el: Use the new Gnu Emacs `rectangle-mark-mode' to
	implement Brief Column Marking.
	Also finished implementing the existing register functions.

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.12.

2019-05-05  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-bookmark.el: Use the Fringe to show bookmark numbers rather
	than the Margin. The Margin is more flexible, but I think it looks
	odd with the Margin on the outside of the Fringe. It also looks
	weird when the margin is suddenly added.

	* b-compat.el: Removed the Margin flag.

	* b-editing.el:
	* b-marking.el:
	* b-movement.el: Cleaned up remaining compiler warnings.

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.11.

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.10.

	* b-bookmark.el (b-current-column): Fixed documentation.

	* b-editing.el (b-insert-line): Indent by calling the function
	invoked by RET rather than assuming this is `newline-and-indent',
	which it isn't in c-mode.

2019-02-20  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el: Changed all the elisp files to remove the byte-compiler
	warnings, which were mostly to do with DocString formats.

2019-02-04  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-mode-map): Added key mapping for the new function.

	* b-bookmark.el (b-allocate-next-available-bookmark): Added new
	command to allocate the next available free bookmark, regardless
	of number.

	* b-compat.el: Correction to fix to silence the byte-compiler.

2019-02-02  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.09, to
	reflect all the recent fixes.

	* b-compat.el: The code to silence the byte-compiler warnings
	wasn't working in Emacs 26.

	* b-bookmark.el (b-read-bookmark-number): Fixed bug with invalid
	input reading bookmark number.
	Fixed compile warning for (labels).
	(b-margin-support-flag): Fixed compile warning.
	(b-bookmark-number-face): Scaled down font size of bookmark number face.

2019-02-01  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-compat.el (b-margin-support-flag): Fix bug preventing the
	bookmark number from showing in the margin.

	* b-movement.el (b-window-height): Fixed bug causing paging to
	move too far when line-spacing was set to something.

2004-02-14  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-marking.el (b-copy-region): Behaviour of `kill-ring-save' has
	changed in 21.3.50, so code adjusted to emphasise region by hand.

2004-02-04  Mike Woolley  <mike@arielcommunications.co.uk>

	* b-compat.el: Disable use of margins in CVS Emacs, as there are
	many display bugs.

2003-04-10  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-marking.el (b-yank): Only indent line mode yank if buffer is
	in a programming mode.
