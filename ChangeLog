2023-03-28  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf.el (brf-set-menu-item-property): Modifying the Edit menu failed on Linux.
	‚óè Modifying the Edit menu failed because the builtin menus are in
	pure storage, which is write protected on Linux (& maybe others,
	but not on macOS).
	
	‚óè So changed `brf-set-menu-item-property`to copy a menu item
	before trying to modify it.
	
2023-03-27  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf.el (brf-set-menu-item-property): Fixed problem with Emacs
	disabling the menu and toolbar Cut & Copy items if there is no
	marked region, unlike the corresponding Brf-mode keyboard
	commands.
	‚óè Also map ‚åò-c on macOS to `brf-copy-region' to be consistent with
	the Copy menu item and ‚åò-v binding.

	* brf-marking.el (brf-mark-default):  Don't show the "Mark set"
	message when copying the default marked region.
	
2023-03-21  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el (brf-mark): Reverted the simulation of "Inclusive Mark".
	It didn't work well, so I've reverted the code so that Brf-mode
	only uses non-inclusive marking again. A proper implementation
	really needs the same kind of code that Line Marking uses, but
	given the minor importance of this feature I don't think its worth it.
	(brf-mark-column): Also reverted the code that moved Column &
	Character marking forward 1 char by default. It now only moves if
	a prefix arg is supplied.

	* brf.el (brf-version): Increased version to 1.25.
	(minor-mode-menu-from-indicator): Fixed problem where the Brf-mode
	modeline "lighter" menu shows the Edit menu items that it finds in
	the `brf-mode' keymap with the Brf menu as a sub-menu, rather than
	just showing the Brf menu.

2023-02-02  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf.el (brf-mode-map): Keymap changes to reflect what it
	actually says in the documentation üòä
	‚óè Map M-r to `redo' if a function of that name is available.
	‚óè Map Insert keys to paste.

	* *.el: Updated Copyright years.

2023-01-31  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el: Big changes to marking:
	‚óè If there is an existing active region, this is used as the
	initial marked area rather than just starting marking afresh.
	Switching between marking modes adjusts the current
	region to suite the new mode. This replicates the behaviour
	of Brief itself.
	‚óè Added explicit command for Column Marking to be able to
	implement the above.
	‚óè Added explicit commands for Non-inclusive & Inclusive Marking
	rather than just calling `set-mark-command'.
	‚óè Inclusive Marking is simulated by moving point one more position
	to include the initial character.
	‚óè Abstracted check for `rectangle-mode' into its own function.

	* brf.el (brf-mode-map): Changed the keymap to use the new commands.

2022-08-17  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el (brf-mark-default): Added custom option to enable
	the pre-existing feature of marking the enclosing SEXP by default in
	Lisp modes rather than the current line.

	* brf.el (brf-version): Increased version to 1.24.

2022-08-07  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el (brf-start-line-marking): Better fix for the
	'org-indent-mode' moving 2 lines issue.
	‚óè The previous fix was not the right fix, as in general we *do*
	want point to be moved forward a line when the user moves point to
	somewhere that's not at the start of a line (eg line-marking a
	function with M-l + C-M-e).
	‚óè The actual problem is 'next-line' at BOL in 'org-indent-mode'
	doesn't necessarily go to BOL on the next line.  So I've attacked
	the problem directly by setting 'goal-column' to 0 during
	line-marking, to force Emacs to try to keep to the start of the
	line.

2022-07-10  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el (brf-mark-line-hook): Removed 3rd argument to
	`count-lines' in the previous change, which is only supported on
	Gnu Emacs >= 28.

	* brf.el:
	* brf-marking.el: Fixed compiler warnings on Gnu Emacs 28.

2022-07-07  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el (brf-mark-line-hook): Incorrectly moves 2 lines
	forward instead of a single one when org-indent-mode is enabled.
	‚óè Modified the code in 'brf-mark-line-hook' so that moving forward
	a line after having to move to the beginning of the line is only
	done when point hasn't already implicitly moved forward a line.
	‚óè Also fixed this issue for the case where the last line of the
	file is incomplete (ie doesn't end in EOL).

	* brf.el (brf-version): Increased version to 1.23.

2022-01-04  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-bookmark.el (brf-bookmark-face): Fixed problem where the
	bookmark highlight doesn't extend to the right margin on Emacs 27.
	It seems Emacs 27 requires the new face attribute `:extend' for
	this to happen.

	* brf.el (brf-version): Increased version to 1.22.

	* *.el: Updated Copyright years.

2021-12-23  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el (brf-mark-line-hook): Fixed bug in line-marking
	which caused backspace to emphasise a bogus region.

	* brf.el: Changed package summary text.
	(brf-version): Increased version to 1.21.

	* *.el: Changed references of README.md to README.org.

2021-05-09  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-undo.el (brf-undo-point): Fixed problem where an initial cursor movement
	after opening a file couldn't be undone.
	* brf-marking.el (brf-mark-line-hook): Fixed problem where the
	user setting the mark didn't always end line-marking.

2021-04-30  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-undo.el (brf-undo-post-command-hook): Changed `caddr' to
	`cl-caddr', as `caddr' is (rather strangely) not defined in Emacs < 26
	other than in `cl' and so `brf-undo' got broken in these older
	versions by the forced migration from `cl` to `cl-lib`.

2021-04-14  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el (brf-mark-line-hook): Fixes to line-marking mode:
	‚óè Work better in the presence of hidden lines (e.g. in Org mode).
	‚óè Consistent behaviour of right/left cursor movement.
	‚óè Handle incomplete last line better, avoiding the chaos caused by
	`temporary-goal-column'.
	‚óè Cancel line-marking if the user issues a command that reset the
	mark, like `mark-defun' or `mark-whole-buffer'.

	* brf.el (brf-version): Increased version to 1.20.

2021-04-10  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el: Fixed compiler warning "the function `(setf
	get-register)' is not known to be defined".

2021-04-10  Michael Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el (brf-mark-line): Changed line-marking so that
	invoking it again cancels line-marking (just like in real Brief).
	(brf-stop-line-marking): Refactored line-marking so that all the
	code associated with the termination of line-marking is in this
	function.

2021-03-25  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el (brf-copy-to-register): Don't emphasise the
	region when deleting.
	(brf-column-marking-p): Simplified with `bound-and-true-p'.
	(brf-mark-line): Changed message to "Mark set (line mode)".

	* brf-movement.el (brf-scroll-screen, brf-scroll-line):
	* brf.el (brf-mode): Removed global setting of
	`scroll-preserve-screen-position' to t and instead bind it to 1
	when paging and nil when scrolling. This was necessary because the
	"t" setting doesn't always preserve the screen position when paging.

	* *.el: Updated Copyright years.

2020-08-11  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf.el:
	* brf-movement.el:
	* brf-menu.el:
	* brf-compat.el:
	* brf-bookmark.el:
	Migrated use of `cl' to `cl-lib' now that Emacs 27 has deprecated `cl'.
	This now means Emacs 24.3 becomes the minimum package requirement.

2020-06-26  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-window.el (brf-resize-window-start):
	* brf.el (brf-mode-map): Changed Window Resize (F2) to work like
	in real Brief, where the user first picks an edge and then uses
	the cursor keys to move that edge.

	* brf-window.el (brf-zoom-window):
	* brf.el (brf-mode-map):
	Added implementation of Brief's "Zoom Window Toggle" on M-F2.

	* brf.el (brf-mode-map):
	Added key for Non-Inclusive Mark (M-a), although in Emacs marking
	is always Non-Inclusive, so M-m has the same effect as M-a.
	(brf-version): Increased version to 1.19.

2020-06-22  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf.el (brf-mode-menu): Added a menu to show the harder to
	access features and help information. Fixed problem with no mode
	menu on the mode-line "lighter".
	(brf-version): Increased version to 1.18.
	Read Brf Version from the package info, if `pkg-info' is installed.
	(brf-mode-map): Added local bindings for the toolbar cut & paste
	commands, so they run the Brf Mode versions.
	(brf-mode): Override "Select and Paste" menu item to correctly
	handle Line Mode.

	* brf-marking.el (menu-bar-select-yank): Override "Select and
	Paste" menu item to correctly handle Line Mode.
	(brf-insert-text): Refactored all the pasting code to use this
	fundamental function to handle Line & Column Mode pasting.
	(brf-yank-pop): Fixed bug where text wasn't correctly removed when
	`yank-pop'-ing a line-mode item followed by a column-mode item.

2020-03-29  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-bookmark.el (brf-fringe-support-flag): Removed extraneous
	argument to `require'.
	(brf-make-set-bookmark): Removed extraneous `number-to-string' call.

2020-03-25  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-marking.el (brf-mark-default): Reverted change to supply
	extra args to `backward-up-list', as this caused compilation
	warnings on Emacs 24.

2020-03-24  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-bookmark.el (brf-bookmark-menu-font-lock): Changed "NOT SET"
	face to `font-lock-warning-face' to be consistent with the other "font-lock"
	faces used for the menu.

	* brf.el (brf-version): Increased version to 1.17.

2020-03-22  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf-menu.el:
	* brf-bookmark.el: Created `brf-menu' as a self-contained
	replacement for `generic-menu', as that package was outdated and
	not widely available. It also had some bugs which stopped some of
	the features (like font-lock) from working.

2020-03-15  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* brf.el (brf-mode): Forgot to add autoload marker.

	* brf-bookmark.el: Removed extraneous `format' calls in error messages.

	This the first version available as a MELPA package (as version 1.16).

2020-03-13  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* *.el: Changed package-name (& mode prefix) to "brf" from "b".
	Renamed all the lisp files from b-*.el to brf-*.el.
	Changed all the symbol names to the new prefix.
	Added a local-variables section to each file set the default
	indentation settings (for those viewers who have non-standard
	settings).

2020-03-12  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el: Changed to define the mode using the modern
	`define-minor-mode', rather than doing it by hand the old way. Now
	that I've abandon compatibility with XEmacs & GNU Emacs versions
	older than 24, this is unlikely to be a problem.
	Added the keymap initialisation to it's `defvar', rather than
	having a second step.

2020-03-11  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-bookmark.el (b-list-bookmarks): Added Delete and Delete All
	commands to the bookmark menu.
	Also added some code to fontify the menu buffer.

2020-03-09  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-bookmark.el (b-list-bookmarks): Changed the code which makes
	`generic-menu' optional to use `declare-function', as this is a bit
	cleaner.

	* b-bookmark.el:
	* b-marking.el:
	* b-window.el: Changed `error' to `user-error'.

2020-03-08  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-mode-map): Put key-mapping code back to how it was
	before, because the MELPA package checking tool had warnings about
	the new code.
	Added package dependency on `fringe-helper'.

	* b-bookmark.el (b-list-bookmarks): Fixed compiler warning when
	the package is compiled without `generic-menu' installed.

	* *.el: Changed GPL 3 text to the very latest.
	Clarified usages of #'.

	* LICENSE.md: Added this file with GPL 3 text.

2020-03-06  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* *.el: Updated GPL to version 3.

	* b.el: Removed the ChangeLog section as it was getting too long.
	Archived the older entries to the end of this file.

2020-03-05  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el: Changed to lexical-binding.
	Added package tags.
	(b-mode): Changes for lexical-binding.

	* b-bookmark.el: Changed to lexical-binding.
	(b-get-bookmark): Added this new accessor to
	replace all the explicit `aref' calls.
	(b-create-bookmark): Changes for lexical-binding.
	(b-next-bookmark): Workaround lexical-binding "unused variable" warning.
	(b-list-bookmarks): Stopped unavailability of `generic-menu'
	generating an error.

	* b-window.el:
	* b-undo.el:
	* b-movement.el:
	* b-marking.el:
	* b-editing.el:
	* b-compat.el: Changed to lexical-binding.

2020-02-29  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-movement.el (b-scroll-screen): Changed the code to use the
	core C Emacs scrolling functions for paging if
	`scroll-preserve-screen-position' is available and set. This is
	because the builtin functions are more accurate when dealing with
	mixed font heights, hidden lines etc.

	* b.el (b-mode): Set `scroll-preserve-screen-position' to t, if
	available in this version of Emacs.
	* b.el (b-version): Increased version to 1.16 to reflect the
	recent changes..

2020-02-26  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-movement.el (b-window-height): Changed this function to handle
	the different kinds of line-spacing and to return a more accurate
	idea of the window height.
	(b-page-down):
	(b-page-up): Not sure why I was subtracting 1 from the
	window-height (presumably because the window-height was wrong), so
	removed this.
	Also set minimum scrolled lines to 1.

	* b-bookmark.el:
	* b-movement.el: Put back the non "cl-" macros, as this is how the
	code was originally and these days I'm silencing byte-compiler
	warnings about `cl' by requiring it at compile time.

2020-02-20  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-bookmark.el (b-make-set-bookmark): Changed to return a named
	function rather than a lambda, so that the functions show up in the
	mode / keymap help etc.

	* b.el (b-mode-map): Added new command to delete all windows other
	than the current one.  I also realised the way I was defining the
	key map made it difficult to modify it interactively when writing
	new code, so I've changed this now.

2020-02-19  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-window.el (b-delete-current-window): Added function (& f4
	key-mapping) to delete the current window.

	* b.el (b-mode): Force conservative scrolling in B mode.
	(b-version): Increased B package version to 1.15.

	* b-marking.el (b-insert-register): Handle prefix arg the same as
	`insert-register'. In particular, with no prefix arg set point
	after the inserted text.

2020-02-12  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-window.el: New file to implement Brief-style window
	management.

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.14.
	(b-mode-map): Added key bindings for Brief-style window management.

2020-02-11  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-undo.el: Finished implementing Cursor Motion Undo (finally!).
	(b-undo-post-command-hook): Made Undo & Redo work
	properly with both default Emacs Undo and Redo(+).el.
	(b-undo-debug): Fixed the behaviour so it updates going down the
	page and tries to keep the most recent line visible. Also limited
	the lists to the first 15 items.

	* b.el: Brought the Copyright statements up-to-date.
	(b-version): Increased B package version to 1.13.

2020-02-02  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-mode-map): I had forgotten to put undo on M-u, in
	addition to kp-*.

	* b-marking.el (b-emphasise-region): Changed to display a message
	if the region was not emphasised (because the other end of the
	region is not visible), rather than do nothing as happened
	before. This was based on the behaviour of `indicate-copied-region'.

2020-01-31  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-marking.el:
	* b.el: Use the new Gnu Emacs `rectangle-mark-mode' to
	implement Brief Column Marking.
	Also finished implementing the existing register functions.

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.12.

2019-05-05  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-bookmark.el: Use the Fringe to show bookmark numbers rather
	than the Margin. The Margin is more flexible, but I think it looks
	odd with the Margin on the outside of the Fringe. It also looks
	weird when the margin is suddenly added.

	* b-compat.el: Removed the Margin flag.

	* b-editing.el:
	* b-marking.el:
	* b-movement.el: Cleaned up remaining compiler warnings.

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.11.

2019-02-28  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.10.

	* b-bookmark.el (b-current-column): Fixed documentation.

	* b-editing.el (b-insert-line): Indent by calling the function
	invoked by RET rather than assuming this is `newline-and-indent',
	which it isn't in c-mode.

2019-02-20  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el: Changed all the elisp files to remove the byte-compiler
	warnings, which were mostly to do with DocString formats.

2019-02-04  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-mode-map): Added key mapping for the new function.

	* b-bookmark.el (b-allocate-next-available-bookmark): Added new
	command to allocate the next available free bookmark, regardless
	of number.

	* b-compat.el: Correction to fix to silence the byte-compiler.

2019-02-02  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-version): Increased B package version to 1.09, to
	reflect all the recent fixes.

	* b-compat.el: The code to silence the byte-compiler warnings
	wasn't working in Emacs 26.

	* b-bookmark.el (b-read-bookmark-number): Fixed bug with invalid
	input reading bookmark number.
	Fixed compile warning for (labels).
	(b-margin-support-flag): Fixed compile warning.
	(b-bookmark-number-face): Scaled down font size of bookmark number face.

2019-02-01  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-compat.el (b-margin-support-flag): Fix bug preventing the
	bookmark number from showing in the margin.

	* b-movement.el (b-window-height): Fixed bug causing paging to
	move too far when line-spacing was set to something.

2016-09-24  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-movement.el (b-scroll-screen): Emacs 25 changes -
	changed programmatic use of `forward-line' to `next-line' to
	silence warning.

2013-10-13  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-marking.el (b-lisp-mode-p): Fixed bit rot by formatting the
	mode name first before looking to see if it contains "lisp".

2013-01-19  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-start-line-marking): Changes for Emacs 24.

2009-10-21  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b.el (b-mode-map): Added separate keymapping for kp-delete,
	which seems to be necessary in Emacs 23.

2004-02-14  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-marking.el (b-copy-region): Behaviour of `kill-ring-save' has
	changed in 21.3.50, so code adjusted to emphasise region by hand.

2004-02-04  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-compat.el: Disable use of margins in CVS Emacs, as there are
	many display bugs.

2003-04-10  Mike Woolley  <mike@bulsara.com>

	* b-marking.el (b-yank): Only indent line mode yank if buffer is
	in a programming mode.

2002-01-08 Mike Woolley <mike@bulsara.com>

	* Version 1.08
	* Split into separate files for ease of working.

2001-08-12 Mike Woolley <mike@bulsara.com>

	* Version 1.07
	* Lots of small changes and bug fixes.

2001-08-02 Mike Woolley <mike@bulsara.com>

	* Version 1.06
	* Renamed to b-mode, due to the large number of `brief.el's out
	there and particularly because this mode is not really an
	emulation of Brief, more a homage to Brief in Emacs.
	* Added new commands to cycle backwards and forwards through the
	bookmarks and to list them.
	* Added new prefix key \C-c\c-b for infrequently used commands for
	this mode.

2001-05-21 Mike Woolley <mike@bulsara.com>

	* Version 1.05
	* Fixed some minor problems in the bookmark code.
	* Now displays the bookmark number in the overlay.
	* Turned `brief-protect-overlay' into a closure.
	* Add command to remove bookmarks.

2001-03-12 Mike Woolley <mike@bulsara.com>

	* Version 1.04
	* Added bookmarks.
	* Moved the XEmacs specific code into functions.
	* Removed the byte compiler warnings.

2001-02-22 Mike Woolley <mike@bulsara.com>

	* Version 1.03
	* Added tab key handling.
	* newline-and-indent setup in global map.
	* Tidied up doc strings.

2001-02-15 Mike Woolley <mike@bulsara.com>

	* Version 1.02
	* Changed M-d to delete a line rather than kill a line.

2000-01-01 Mike Woolley <mike@bulsara.com>

	* Version 1.01
	* Added Brief-style Home and End key handling

2000-01-01 Mike Woolley <mike@bulsara.com>

	* Version 1.00
	* Initial version.
	* Cursor motion undo not working yet.

1999-10-14 Mike Woolley <mike@bulsara.com>

	* Initial version of the code that would become `brief.el'.
